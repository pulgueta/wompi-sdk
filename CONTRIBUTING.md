## Development

## Commit convention

Before making a PR, check if your commits comply with the convention used in the repository.

When making a commit, it is required to follow the appropriate convention as in the example:

- `feat:`: All changes that bring new code.
- `fix:`: Changes that fix a bug.
- `refactor:`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `docs:`: Documentation changes (README, LICENSE, etc.).
- `build:`: Changes in the project build.
- `test:`: Changes that affect tests (adding new ones, removing tests, etc.),
- `ci:`: Changes in the project's CI/CD
- `chore:`: Any other changes that do not relate to the above
